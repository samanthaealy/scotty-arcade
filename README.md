Created by Samantha Ealy, Annie Bae, Jack Lance, Jonathan Dyer, Christopher Cortez, Shankar Srinivasan.

Final Project for 24-780 Engineering Computation at Carnegie Mellon University.

The arcade includes Frogger, Space Invaders, Tetris, Brick Breaker, and Snake. My main contribution to this project was programming Frogger. All 5 games were developed independently and then combined into one application.
